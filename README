I wanted to test if I could use partial function application in scala
to do a very clean implementation of a feature vector that I need for
another project.

My initial hypotheses are that either:
1) there is a memory leak in the way scala handles anonymous classes
2) there is a memory leak/strange behaviour in mallet's AugmentableFeatureVector/Alphabet

If you try to run a reasonable number of runs (say 2500) with a reasonable
number of adds (say 2500), you cannot run this test in a reasonable
amount of memory (say 512 MB)


Update:
After writing noMallet.scala I think that the problem has to
do with mallet rather than scala (a huge relief)
